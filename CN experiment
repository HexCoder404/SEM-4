Title: To implement various basic networking commands
Aim: - To implement various basic networking commands
System Software: -• Ubuntu System
Theory/ Working Principle:
1).Ping Command Syntax:
Short for Packet Internet Groper, ping is a utility used to verify whether or not a network data
packet is capable of being distributed to an address without errors. The ping utility is commonly
used to check for network errors.
2) Tracert Command
The tracert command is used to visually see a network packet being sent and received and the
amount of hops required for that packet to get to its destination. Users with Microsoft Windows
2000 and Windows XP who need additional information network latency and network loss should also
consider using the path ping command.
3).IPCONFIG: -
(Internet Protocol Configuration) A Windows command line utility that is used to manage the IP
address assigned to the machine it is running in. Used without any additional parameters, it
displays the computer's currently assigned IP, subnet mask and default gateway addresses.
4)netstat:-
Abbreviation of network statistics, the netstat command is a command found in almost all
command line environments that allow you to view the statistics of the network.
5) ARP
Short for Address Resolution Protocol, ARP is used with the IP for mapping a 32-bit Internet
Protocol address to a MAC address that is recognized in the local network specified in RFC 826.
Once recognized, the server or networking device returns a response containing the required address.
6. NSLOOKUP:
Nslookup (stands for “Name Server Lookup”) is a useful command for getting information
from the DNS server. It is a network administration tool for querying the Domain Name System
(DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or any other specific DNS record. It is
also used to troubleshoot DNS related problems.
7. RARP:-
Rarp manipulates the kernel's RARP table in various ways. The primary options are clearing an
address mapping entry and manually setting up one. For debugging purposes, the rarp program
also allows a complete dump of the RARP table.
8.ROUTE:
Route command in Linux is used when you want to work with the IP/kernel routing table. It is
mainly used to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via an interface. It is used for
showing or update the IP/kernel routing table.
9.DIG
The dig command in Linux is used to gather DNS information. It stands for Domain Information
Groper, and it collects data about Domain Name Servers. The dig command is helpful for
diagnosing DNS problems, but is also used to display DNS information. This guide will help you
understand and use the Linux dig command.
conclusion:
Hence we understand the concept of various basic networking commands and perform thevarious commands in linux.

Aim: - To perform an experiment using WIRESHARK to understand the
operation of TCP/IP layers.
System Software: -Wireshark,Ubuntu System
Theory/ Working Principle:
WIRESHARK is a network packet analyzer . A network packet
analyzer presents captured packet data in as much data as possible.
Here are some reasons people use Wireshark:
1. Network Administrators use it to troubleshoot network problems
2. Network security engineers use it to examine security problems
3. QA engineers use it to veri†y network applications
4. Developers use it to debug protocol implementations
5. People use it to learn network protocol internals
Analyzing Data Packets on Wireshark
Wireshark shows you three different panes for inspecting packet data. The Packet
List, the top pane, is a list of all the packets in the capture. When you click on a
packet, the other two panes change to show you the details about the selected
packet. You can also tell if the packet is part of a conversation.
Wireshark Capture Filters
Capture filters limit the captured packets by the filter. Meaning if the packets don't
match the filter, Wireshark won't save them. Here are some examples of capture filters:
host IP-address: this filter limits the capture to traffic to and from the IP address net
192.168.0.0/24: this filter captures all traffic on the subnet.
dst host IP-address: capture packets sent to the
specified host. port 53: capture traffic on port
53 only.

Aim: - Design VPN and configure RIP using packet Tracer
System Software: - Cisco Packet Tracer software
Theory/ Working Principle:
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) protocol is the intradomain (interior) routing
protocol which is based on distance vector routing and it is used inside an
autonomous system.Routers and network links are called nodes. The first
column of the routing table is the destination address. The cost metric in this
protocol is hop count which is the number of networks which need to be passed
to reach a destination. Here infinity is defined by a fixed number which is 16; it
means that using a Rip network cannot have more than 15 hops. RIP Version-1:
It is an open standard protocol.It is a classful routing protocol. Updates are
broadcasted. Its administrative distance value is 120, it means it is not reliable,
The lesser the administrative distance value the reliability is much more. Its
metric is hop count and max hop count is 15. There will be a total of 16 routers
in the network. When there will be the same number of hop to reach the
destination, Rip starts to perform load balancing. Load balancing means if
there are three ways to reach the destination and each way has the same number of
routers then packets will be sent to each path to reach the destination. This
reduces traffic and also the load is balanced. It is used in small companies, in
this protocol routing tables are updated in each 30 sec. Whenever a link breaks,
the rip traces out another path to reach the destination. It is one of the slowest
protocols.

Aim: - Configure OSPF using packet Tracer
System Software: - Cisco Packet Tracer software
Theory/ Working Principle:
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state routing protocol that is used to
find the best path between the source and the destination router using its own
Shortest Path First). OSPF is developed by Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) as one of the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), i.e, the protocol which aims
at moving the packet within a large autonomous system or routing domain. It is
a network layer protocol which works on protocol number 89 and uses AD value
110. OSPF uses multicast address 224.0.0.5 for normal communication and
224.0.0.6 for update to designated router(DR)/Backup Designated Router
(BDR).

Aim: - Telnet Using Packet Tracer
System Software: -Cisco Packet Tracer
Theory/ Working Principle:
TELNET stands for Terminal Network. It is a type of protocol that enables one
computer to connect to the local computer. It is used as a standard TCP/IP
protocol for virtual terminal service which is provided by ISO. The computer
which starts the connection is known as the local computer.
The computer which is being connected to i.e. which accepts the connection
known as the remote computer.
During telnet operation, whatever is being performed on the remote computer
will be displayed by the local computer. Telnet operates on a client/server
principle. The local computer uses a telnet client program and the remote
computers use a telnet server program.
Logging
The logging process can be further categorized into two parts:
1. Local Login
2. Remote Login
1. Local Login: Whenever a user logs into its local system, it is known as local
login.
2. Remote Login: Remote Login is a process in which users can log in to a
remote site i.e. computer and use services that are available on the remote
computer. With the help of remote login, a user is able to understand the result
of transferring the result of processing from the remote computer to the local
computer.
Advantages of Telnet
1. It provides remote access to someone’s computer system.
2. Telnet allows the user for more access with fewer problems in data
transmission.
3. Telnet saves a lot of time.
4. The oldest system can be connected to a newer system with telnet
having different operating systems.
Disadvantages of Telnet
1. As it is somehow complex, it becomes difficult to beginners in
understanding.
2. Data is sent here in form of plain text, that’s why it is not so secured.
3. Some capabilities are disabled because of not proper interlinking of the
remote and local devices.
Procedure:
1) Select 3 PCs from the end devices. Select router and and switch as shown below.
2) Select router enter the following code.(CLI)
enable
configure terminal
hostname R1
interface g0/0
ip add 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
end
wr
configure terminal
enable secret cisco
end
exit
enable
cisco
configure terminal
line vty 0 5

Aim: - SSh Using Packet Tracer
System Software: -Cisco Packet Tracer
Theory/ Working Principle:
SSH(Secure Shell) is an access credential that is used in the SSH Protocol. In
other words, it is a cryptographic network protocol that is used for transferring
encrypted data over the network. It allows you to connect to a server, or
multiple servers, without having you to remember or enter your password for
each system that is to login remotely from one system into another.
It always comes in key pair:
1. Public key – Everyone can see it, no need to protect it. (for encryption
function)
2. Private key – Stays in computer, must be protected. (for decryption
function)
Key pairs can be of the following types:
1. User Key – If public key and private key remain with the user.
2. Host Key – If the public key and private key are on a remote system.
3. Session key – Used when a large amount of data is to be transmitted.
How SSH Works ?
It uses asymmetric cipher for performing encryption and decryption. There are
many encryption methods:
rsa, dsa, ed25519 etc.
SSH is key based authentication that is not prone to brute-force attack.
It is more convenient and secure than login ids and passwords .There is no
exposure of valid credentials, if a server has been compromised.
Procedure:
SSH
1) Select 3 PC from the end devices. Select router and and switch as shown below.
2) Select router enter the following code.
enable
configure terminal
hostname R1
interface g0/0
ip add 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
